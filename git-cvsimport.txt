NAME
----
git-cvsimport - Salvage your data out of another SCM people love to hate


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git cvsimport' [-h] [-v] [-d <CVSROOT>]
	      [-A <author-conv-file>] [-p <options-for-cvsps>]
	      [-C <git_repository>] [-z <fuzz>] [-i] [-u] [-s <subst>]
	      [-m] [-M <regex>] [-S <regex>]
	      [-r <remote>] [-R] [<CVS_module>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a CVS repository into git. It will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by 'cvsps'.
At least version 3.2 is required.

*WARNING:* for certain situations the import leads to incorrect results.
Please see the section <<issues,ISSUES>> for further reference.

You should *never* do any work of your own on the branches that are
created by 'git cvsimport'.  By default initial import will create and
populate a "master" branch from the CVS repository's main branch which
you're free to work with; after that, you need to 'git merge'
incremental imports, or any CVS branches, yourself.  It is advisable
to specify a named remote via -r to separate and protect the incoming
branches.

If you intend to set up a shared public repository that all developers can
read/write, or if you want to use linkgit:git-cvsserver[1], then you
probably want to make a bare clone of the imported repository,
and use the clone as the shared repository.
See linkgit:gitcvs-migration[7].


OPTIONS
-------
-v::
	Verbosity: let 'cvsimport' report what it is doing.

-d <CVSROOT>::
	The root of the CVS archive. May be local (a simple path) or remote;
	currently, only the :local:, :ext: and :pserver: access methods
	are supported. If not given, 'git cvsimport' will try to read it
	from `CVS/Root`. If no such file exists, it checks for the
	`CVSROOT` environment variable.

<CVS_module>::
	The CVS module you want to import. Relative to <CVSROOT>.
	If not given, 'git cvsimport' tries to read it from
	`CVS/Repository`.

-C <target-dir>::
        The git repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-r <remote>::
	The git remote to import this CVS repository into.
	Moves all CVS branches into remotes/<remote>/<branch>
	akin to the way 'git clone' uses 'origin' by default.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-u::
	Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.

-s <subst>::
	Substitute the character "/" in branch names with <subst>

-p <options-for-cvsps>::
	Additional options for cvsps.
	The options '-u' and '-A' are implicit and should not be used here.
+
If you need to pass multiple options, separate them with a comma.

-z <fuzz>::
	Pass the timestamp fuzz factor to cvsps, in seconds. If unset,
	cvsps defaults to 300s.

-m::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option
	will enable default regexes that try to capture the source
	branch name from the commit message.
	Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-M <regex>::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a custom
	regex. It can be used with '-m' to enable the default regexes
	as well. You must escape forward slashes.
+
The regex must capture the source branch name in $1.
+
This option can be used several times to provide several detection regexes.
+
Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-S <regex>::
	Skip paths matching the regex.

-A <author-conv-file>::
	CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its
	commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file
	maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and
	optional timezone:
+
---------
	exon=Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> +0200
	spawn=Simon Pawn <spawn@frog-pond.org> -0500

---------
+
'git cvsimport' will make it appear as those authors had
their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly
all along.  If a timezone is specified, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE will
have the corresponding offset appended to it.
+
For convenience, this data is saved to `$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors`
each time the '-A' option is provided and read from that same
file each time 'git cvsimport' is run.
+
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to
export changes back to CVS again later with
'git cvsexportcommit'.

-R::
	Generate a `$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions` file containing a mapping from CVS
	revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs.  The generated file
	will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported;
	each line will look like
+
---------
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
---------
+
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when
doing incremental imports.
+
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit
messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
+
Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.


-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the script reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
In 2012 a serious bug dating back to 2006 in cvsps was exposed.  The
ancestry-branch tracking formerly enabled by -A did not work;
translations of branchy repos could be mangled.  While the
--fast-export mode in 3.x releases of cvsps solved the problem, it
required an emergency rewrite of git-cvsimport.  Some compatibility
with older versions was unavoidably lost

The -a, -k, -o, -L and -P options in older versions of this tool have been
removed; -kk (keyword expansion suppression) is always on.  

The -m, -M, and -R options are not presently implemented. It is
planned that -R will be restored in future versions of this program;
-m and -M may be either restored or retired in favor of more flexible
editing tools such as 'git-filter-branch' and 'reposurgeon'.

ISSUES
------
Recent versions of CVS create a 'commitid' field to tie together
changesets, which prevents various problems arising from timestamp
skew.  If the 'cvsps' program used by 'git-cvsimport' finds a portion
of your history that does not have commitids (which is normal if you
have commits from before 2004), it will warn you of this; see the
cvsps manual page for details on what this implies.

Not all sequences of CVS operation can be translated into an import stream.
'cvsps' tries to warn you about repository histories it can't handle.

Here are some other known bugs:

 * All files from the branching point are added to a branch even if
   never added in CVS.
 * This applies to files added to the source branch *after* a daughter
   branch was created: if previously no commit was made on the daughter
   branch they will erroneously be added to the daughter branch in git.

If you suspect that any of these issues may apply to the repository you
want to import consider using these alternative tools:

* cvs2git (part of cvs2svn), `http://cvs2svn.tigris.org`
* parsecvs, `http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~keithp/parsecvs`
