git-cvsimport - Salvage your data out of another SCM people love to hate


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git cvsimport' [-A <author-conv-file>] [-b] [-C <git_repository>] 
              [-d <CVSROOT>] [-h] [-i] [-k] [-p <options-for-engine>] 
	      [-P <cvsps-output-file>] [-r <remote>] [-R] [-s <subst>] 
	      [-S <regex>] [-u] [-v] [-z <fuzz>] [<CVS_module>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a CVS repository into git. This tool will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

*WARNING:* The CVS model of version control lends itself to all manner
of perversities; not all sequences of CVS operations can be translated
into an import stream, and importing is not guaranteed to produce a
perfectly accurate representation of CVS history. Please see the
section on <<issues,engine-specific issues>> for further reference.

git cvsimport will do well at translating CVS repositories with a
linear or close-to-linear revision history, no merges, and
well-disciplined tagging practices.  More complex cases will require
human judgment amplified by a repository-editing tool such as
http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon[reposurgeon].

OPTIONS
-------
-A <author-conv-file>::
	CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its
	commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file
	maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and
	optional timezone:
+
---------
	exon=Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> +0200
	spawn=Simon Pawn <spawn@frog-pond.org> -0500
---------
+
'git cvsimport' will make it appear as those authors had
their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly
all along.
+
For convenience, this data is saved to `$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors`
each time the '-A' option is provided and read from that same
file each time 'git cvsimport' is run.
+
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to
export changes back to CVS again later with
'git cvsexportcommit'.

-b::
        Create a bare repo. If you intend to set up a shared public
	repository that all developers can read/write, or if you want
	to use linkgit:git-cvsserver[1], then you probably want to
	make a bare clone of the imported repository using this
	option. See linkgit:gitcvs-migration[7].

-C <target-dir>::
        The git repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-d <CVSROOT>::
	The root of the CVS archive. It is only necessary to specify
	this option if you are running from somewhere other than a 
	CVS checkout directory; the value is passed to the conversion
	engine to be interpreted.

-e <engine>::
	Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by an engine program,
	which must emit a git fast-import stream to standard output.
	This option changes the engine used; when given, it must be the
	first option on the command line.

-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-k::
	Kill keywords: will extract files with '-kk' from the CVS archive
	to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default
	to preserve compatibility with early imported trees.

-P <cvsps-output-file>::
	Instead of calling a conversion engine, read the provided
	import-stream file. Useful for debugging or when the first
	stage of conversion is being handled outside cvsimport.

-r <remote>::
	The git remote to import this CVS repository into.
	Moves all CVS branches into remotes/<remote>/<branch>
	akin to the way 'git clone' uses 'origin' by default.

-p <options-for-engine>::
	Additional options for the engine. If you need to pass
	multiple options, separate them with a comma.

-R::
	Generate a `$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions` file containing a mapping from CVS
	revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs.  The generated file
	will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported;
	each line will look like
+
---------
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
---------
+
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when
doing incremental imports.
+
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit
messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
+
-s <subst>::
	Substitute the character "/" in branch names with <subst>

-S <regex>::
	Skip paths matching the regex.

-u::
	Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.

-v::
	Verbosity: let 'cvsimport' report what it is doing.

-z <fuzz>::
	Pass the timestamp fuzz factor, in seconds. If unset, this has 
	an engine-dependent default - usually 300s.

<CVS_module>::
	The CVS module you want to import. Relative to <CVSROOT>.  It
	is only necessary to specify this option if you are running
	from somewhere other than a CVS checkout directory; the value
	is passed to the conversion engine to be interpreted.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the program reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.

[[compatibility]]
COMPATIBILITY
-------------
In 2012 two serious bugs dating back to 2006 in cvsps were exposed.  The
ancestry-branch tracking formerly enabled by -A did not work, and
branch detection was generally buggy; translations of branchy repos
could be mangled.  While the --fast-export mode in 3.x releases of
cvsps solved the problem, it required an emergency rewrite of
git-cvsimport.  Some compatibility with older versions was unavoidably
lost

The -a, -o, -m, -M, and -L options in older versions of this tool have
been removed (in effect, -a is always on; you can negate it with
suitably crafted -d arguments).  Certain older versions could take a
named timezone (like "America/Chicago") in an author-map file rather
than just a [+-]hhmm offset; this version doesn't do that, but the
capability may be restored in a future release.

[[issues]]
ENGINE-SPECIFIC ISSUES
----------------------
The conversion engines try to warn you about repository histories they
can't handle; see their individual manual pages to learn how to
interpret the warnings you may receive.

The default conversion engine is 'cvsps'.  If warnings you receive
suggest that the repository translation is invalid, consider switching
engines to 'cvs2git'.

cvsps
~~~~~
The default conversion engine is 'cvsps'; at least version 3.3 is
required.  The cvsps project page is at `http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvsps`.
Things to know about this engine:

* As well as working from within a CVS checkout directory,
  'cvsps' will also adapt without requiring a root or module
  specification when run from within a module subdirectory within a CVS
  repository directory.  When run from within the top level of a CVS
  repository, 'cvsps' requires only a module argument.

* The -S option will interpret exclusion regular expressions using the
  POSIX syntax of regex(7).

* 'cvsps' automatically removes characters in CVS tag and branch names
  that would be illegal in git.

cvs2git
~~~~~~~
The cvs2git project page is at `http://cvs2svn.tigris.org`.  It is
much slower than cvsps, and does not implement some git-cvsimport
options (such as -d and -A), but it handles a wider range of
pathological CVS cases.

* 'cvs2git' takes a path option pointing to a repository module
  subdirectory, defaulting to ".".

* The -S option will interpret exclusion regular expressions using
  Python syntax.

* Illegal characters in branch and tag names will cause cvs2git to
  abort with an error message.
