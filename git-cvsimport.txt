git-cvsimport - Salvage your data out of another SCM people love to hate


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git cvsimport' [-A <author-conv-file>] [-b] [-C <git_repository>] 
              [-d <CVSROOT>] [-h] [-i] [-k] [-m] [-M <regex>] 
	      [-p <options-for-engine>] [-P <cvsps-output-file>] 
	      [-r <remote>] [-R] [-s <subst>] [-S <regex>] [-u] 
	      [-v] [-z <fuzz>] [<CVS_module>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a CVS repository into git. This tool will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

*WARNING:* The CVS model of version control lends itself to all manner
of perversities; not all sequences of CVS operations can be translated
into an import stream, and importing is not guaranteed to produce a
perfectly accurate representation of CVS history. Please see the
section on <<issues,engine-specific issues>> for further reference.

OPTIONS
-------
-A <author-conv-file>::
	CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its
	commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file
	maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and
	optional timezone:
+
---------
	exon=Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> +0200
	spawn=Simon Pawn <spawn@frog-pond.org> -0500
---------
+
'git cvsimport' will make it appear as those authors had
their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly
all along.
+
For convenience, this data is saved to `$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors`
each time the '-A' option is provided and read from that same
file each time 'git cvsimport' is run.
+
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to
export changes back to CVS again later with
'git cvsexportcommit'.

-b::
        Create a bare repo. If you intend to set up a shared public
	repository that all developers can read/write, or if you want
	to use linkgit:git-cvsserver[1], then you probably want to
	make a bare clone of the imported repository using this
	option. See linkgit:gitcvs-migration[7].

-C <target-dir>::
        The git repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-d <CVSROOT>::
	The root of the CVS archive. It is only necessary to specify
	this option if you are running from somewhere other than a 
	CVS checkout directory; the value is passed to the conversion
	engine to be interpreted.

-e <engine>::
	Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by an engine program,
	which must emit a git fast-import stream to standard output.
	This option changes the engine used; when given, it must be the
	first option on the command line.

-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-k::
	Kill keywords: will extract files with '-kk' from the CVS archive
	to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default
	to preserve compatibility with early imported trees.

-m::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option
	will enable default regexes that try to capture the source
	branch name from the commit message.
	Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-M <regex>::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a
	custom regex. It can be used with '-m' to enable the default
	regexes as well. You must escape forward slashes. The regex
	must capture the source branch name in $1. This option can be
	used several times to provide several detection regexes.  +
	Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-P <cvsps-output-file>::
	Instead of calling a conversion engine, read the provided
	import-stream file. Useful for debugging or when the first
	stage of conversion is being handled outside cvsimport.

-r <remote>::
	The git remote to import this CVS repository into.
	Moves all CVS branches into remotes/<remote>/<branch>
	akin to the way 'git clone' uses 'origin' by default.

-p <options-for-engine>::
	Additional options for the engine. If you need to pass
	multiple options, separate them with a comma.

-R::
	Generate a `$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions` file containing a mapping from CVS
	revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs.  The generated file
	will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported;
	each line will look like
+
---------
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
---------
+
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when
doing incremental imports.
+
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit
messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
+
-s <subst>::
	Substitute the character "/" in branch names with <subst>

-S <regex>::
	Skip paths matching the regex.

-u::
	Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.

-v::
	Verbosity: let 'cvsimport' report what it is doing.

-z <fuzz>::
	Pass the timestamp fuzz factor, in seconds. If unset, this has 
	an engine-dependent default - usually 300s.

<CVS_module>::
	The CVS module you want to import. Relative to <CVSROOT>.  It
	is only necessary to specify this option if you are running
	from somewhere other than a CVS checkout directory; the value
	is passed to the conversion engine to be interpreted.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the program reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
In 2012 two serious bugs dating back to 2006 in cvsps were exposed.  The
ancestry-branch tracking formerly enabled by -A did not work, and
branch detection was generally buggy; translations of branchy repos
could be mangled.  While the --fast-export mode in 3.x releases of
cvsps solved the problem, it required an emergency rewrite of
git-cvsimport.  Some compatibility with older versions was unavoidably
lost

The -a, -o, and -L options in older versions of this tool have been
removed (in effect, -a is always on; you can negate it with a suitably
crafted -d argument).  Certain older versions could take a named
timezone (like "America/Chicago") in an author-map file rather than
just a [+-]hhmm offset; this version doesn't do that, but the
capability may be restored in a future release.

The -m, and -M options are not presently implemented. In future
versions of this program -m and -M may be either restored or retired
in favor of more flexible editing tools such as 'git-filter-branch'
and 'reposurgeon'.

ENGINE-SPECIFIC ISSUES
----------------------
The default conversion engine is 'cvsps'; at least version 3.3 is
required.  As well as working from within a CVS checkout directory,
'cvsps' will also adapt without requiring a root or module
specification when run from within a module subdirectory within a CVS
repository directory.  When run from within the top level of a CVS
repository, 'cvsps' requires only a module argument.

'cvsps' tries to warn you about repository histories it can't
handle; see the cvsps manual page to learn how to interpret the warnings
you may receive.

If the warnings you receive suggest that the repository translation is
invalid, consider switching engines to 'cvs2git'. 'cvs2git' takes a
path option pointing to a to a repository module subdirectory,
defaulting to ".".  It is much slower than cvsps, but handles a
wider range of pathological cases.
