NAME
----
git-cvsimport - Salvage your data out of another SCM people love to hate


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git cvsimport' [-h] [-v] [-d <CVSROOT>]
	      [-A <author-conv-file>] [-p <options-for-engine>]
	      [-C <git_repository>] [-z <fuzz>] [-i] [-k] [-u] [-s <subst>]
	      [-P <cvsps-output-file>] [-m] [-M <regex>] [-S <regex>]
	      [-r <remote>] [-R] [<CVS_module>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a CVS repository into git. It will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

*WARNING:* CVS lends itself to all manner of perversities; not all
sequences of CVS operations can be translated into an import stream,
and importing is not guaranteed to produce a perfectly accurate
representation of CVS history. Please see the section
<<issues,ISSUES>> for further reference.

You should *never* do any work of your own on the branches that are
created by 'git cvsimport'.  By default initial import will create and
populate a "master" branch from the CVS repository's main branch which
you're free to work with; after that, you need to 'git merge'
incremental imports, or any CVS branches, yourself.  It is advisable
to specify a named remote via -r to separate and protect the incoming
branches.

If you intend to set up a shared public repository that all developers can
read/write, or if you want to use linkgit:git-cvsserver[1], then you
probably want to make a bare clone of the imported repository,
and use the clone as the shared repository.
See linkgit:gitcvs-migration[7].


OPTIONS
-------
-v::
	Verbosity: let 'cvsimport' report what it is doing.

-d <CVSROOT>::
	The root of the CVS archive. May be local (a simple path) or remote;
	currently, only the :local:, :ext: and :pserver: access methods
	are supported. If not given, 'git cvsimport' will try to read it
	from `CVS/Root`. If no such file exists, it checks for the
	`CVSROOT` environment variable.

<CVS_module>::
	The CVS module you want to import. Relative to <CVSROOT>.
	If not given, 'git cvsimport' tries to read it from
	`CVS/Repository`.

-e <engine>::
	Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by an engine program,
	which must emit a git fast-import stream to standard output.
	This option changes the engine used; when given, it must be the
	first option on the command line.

-C <target-dir>::
        The git repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-r <remote>::
	The git remote to import this CVS repository into.
	Moves all CVS branches into remotes/<remote>/<branch>
	akin to the way 'git clone' uses 'origin' by default.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-k::
	Kill keywords: will extract files with '-kk' from the CVS archive
	to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default
	to preserve compatibility with early imported trees.

-u::
	Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.

-s <subst>::
	Substitute the character "/" in branch names with <subst>

-p <options-for-engine>::
	Additional options for the engine. If you need to pass
	multiple options, separate them with a comma.

-z <fuzz>::
	Pass the timestamp fuzz factor, in seconds. If unset, this has 
	an engine-dependent default - usually 300s.

-P <cvsps-output-file>::
	Instead of calling a conversion engine, read the provided
	import-stream file. Useful for debugging or when the first
	stage of conversion is being handled outside cvsimport.

-m::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option
	will enable default regexes that try to capture the source
	branch name from the commit message.
	Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-M <regex>::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a custom
	regex. It can be used with '-m' to enable the default regexes
	as well. You must escape forward slashes.
+
The regex must capture the source branch name in $1.
+
This option can be used several times to provide several detection regexes.
+
Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.

-S <regex>::
	Skip paths matching the regex.

-A <author-conv-file>::
	CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its
	commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file
	maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and
	optional timezone:
+
---------
	exon=Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> +0200
	spawn=Simon Pawn <spawn@frog-pond.org> -0500

---------
+
'git cvsimport' will make it appear as those authors had
their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly
all along.  If a timezone is specified, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE will
have the corresponding offset appended to it.
+
For convenience, this data is saved to `$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors`
each time the '-A' option is provided and read from that same
file each time 'git cvsimport' is run.
+
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to
export changes back to CVS again later with
'git cvsexportcommit'.

-R::
	Generate a `$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions` file containing a mapping from CVS
	revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs.  The generated file
	will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported;
	each line will look like
+
---------
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
---------
+
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when
doing incremental imports.
+
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit
messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
+
Not presently implemented; see <<COMPATIBILITY>>.


-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the script reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
In 2012 two serious bugs dating back to 2006 in cvsps were exposed.  The
ancestry-branch tracking formerly enabled by -A did not work, and
branch detection was generally buggy; translations of branchy repos
could be mangled.  While the --fast-export mode in 3.x releases of
cvsps solved the problem, it required an emergency rewrite of
git-cvsimport.  Some compatibility with older versions was unavoidably
lost

The -a, -o, and -L options in older versions of this tool have been
removed (in effect, -a is always on; you can negate it with a suitably
crafted -d argument).  Certain older versions could take a named
timezone (like "America/Chicago") in an author-map file rather than
just a [+-]hhmm offset; this version doesn't do that, but the
capability may be restored in a future release.

The -m, and -M options are not presently implemented. In future
versions of this program; -m and -M may be either restored or retired
in favor of more flexible editing tools such as 'git-filter-branch'
and 'reposurgeon'.

[[issues]]
ISSUES
------
The default conversion engine is 'cvsps'; at least version 3.3
is required.  'cvsps' tries to warn you about repository histories it can't
handle; see the cvsps manual page to learn how to interpret the warnings
you may receive.

If the warnings you receive suggest that the repository translation is
invalid, consider switching engines to 'cvs2git'.  It is much slower,
but handles a wider range of pathological cases.
