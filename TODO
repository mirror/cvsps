Run the code through Coverity and cppcheck.

Emit a fossil map that reposurgeon can use.

Simulate CVS's default ignore patterns in a generated .gitignore?

An optional progress meter.

Discard branch-root tags if they have a name that's a prefix of a tip tag.

Make regression-test loads that create funky and invalid tags.  Add some
more test loads derived from CVS repos found in the wild.

git-cvsimport is a wrapper around cvsps; talk with its maintainer
and simplify that code.

Extend direct mode so the fetches of file content for fast-export
mode can be done through it.

Hide data fetching behind an API so that the difference between normal
mode, direct mode, and running from a logfile capture is not visible
in cvsps.c

Maybe scrap options and simplify code?  -A looks like a candidate for
removal.  So does --bkcvs.

Branch-merge detection.  Not sure it's possible but I want to look
into it.  Are merge_ tags standardized enough to use?

Way in the future...does this belong in C?  Maybe not.  Performance
is going to be limited by network latency anyway, so Python or Ruby
might be better tools - code size would drop by about x4, I think.
