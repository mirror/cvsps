.SH DESCRIPTION
CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
repository.  A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made
to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a
single 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable to seeing the
big picture of the evolution of a cvs project.  While CVS tracks revision
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
'atomically' to the repository.
.P
The default reporting mode is designed for humans to look at.  The
--fast-export mode emits a git import stream which can be consumed
by the importers for other version-control systems.  In this mode,
.IP * 5
Each patchset becomes a commit.
.IP * 5
CVS tags become git lightweight tags, and more than one may be
reported per patchset (in the default mode only the latest is reported).
.IP * 5
The HEAD branch is renamed to 'master'.
.IP * 5
Generated tags for branch roots are skipped.
.IP * 5
Other tag and branch names are sanitized to be legal for git.
.IP * 5
Since .cvsignore files have a syntax upward-compatible with that
of .gitignore files, they're renamed.

.TP
.B \-\-norc
when invoking cvs, ignore the .cvsrc file
.TP
.B \-\-summary\-first
when multiple patchset diffs are being generated, put the patchset
summary for all patchsets at the beginning of the output.
.TP
.B \-\-test\-log <captured cvs log file>
for testing changes, you can capture cvs log output, then test against
this captured file instead of hammering some poor CVS server
.TP
.B \-\-bkcvs
(see note below) for use in parsing the BK\->CVS tree log formats only.  This enables
some hacks which are not generally applicable.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-rlog
disable the use of rlog internally.  Note: rlog is
required for stable PatchSet numbering.  Use with care.

Operate on the specified repository (overrides working dir.)
.SH "NOTE ON TAG HANDLING"
Tags are fundamentally 'file at a time' in cvs, but like everything else,
it would be nice to imagine that they are 'repository at a time.'  The
approach cvsps takes is that a tag is assigned to a patchset.  The meaning
of this is that after this patchset, every revision of every file is after
the tag (and conversely, before this patchset, at least one file is still
before the tag).  However, there are two kinds of inconsistent (or 'funky')
tags that can be created, even when following best practices for cvs.  
.PP
The first is what is called a FUNKY tag.  A funky tag is one where
there are patchsets which are chronologically (and thus by patchset
id) earlier than the tag, but are tagwise after.  These tags will be
marked as '**FUNKY**' in the Tag: section of the cvsps output.  When a
funky tag is specified as one of the '\-r' arguments, there are some
number of patchsets which need to be considered out of sequence.  In
this case, the patchsets themselves will be labeled FUNKY and will be
processed correctly.
.PP
The second is called an INVALID tag.  An invalid tag is a tag where
there are patchsets which are chronologically (and thus by patchset
id) earlier than the tag, but which have members which are tagwise
both before, and after the tag, in the same patchset.  If an INVALID
tag is specified as one of the '\-r' arguments, cvsps will flag each
member of the affected patchsets as before or after the tag and the
patchset summary will indicate which members are which, and diffs will
be generated accordingly.
.PP
These may be better explained by examples.  The easiest test case for 
this is two developers, starting in a consistent state.
.IP (a)
developer 1 changes file A(sub1) to A(sub2) and commits, creating
patchset P(sub1) chronologically earlier, thus with a lower patchset id.
.IP (b)
developer 2 changes file B(sub1) to B(sub2) and commits, creating
patchset P(sub2) chronologically later, thus higher patchset id.
.IP (c)
developer 2 B does \fInot\fR do "cvs update", so does not get A(sub2) in
working directory and creates a "tag" T(sub1)
.P
A checkout of T(sub1) should have A(sub1) and B(sub2) and there is no
"patchset" that represents this. In other words, if we label patchset
P(sub2) with the tag there are earlier patchsets which need to be
disregarded.
.PP
An "invalid" tag can be generated with a similar testcase, except:
.IP *
In step (a) developer 1 also changes file C(sub1) to C(sub2)
.IP *
developer 2 does a "selective" cvs update of only file C(sub2)
.IP *
developer 1 does another change from C(sub2) to C(sub3), creating
a new patchset in between the previous P(sub1) and P(sub2)
"P(sub1(sub2))??"
.IP
Then we have step (b) and step (c).  After this, a checkout of T(sub1)
should have A(sub1), B(sub2) and C(sub2).
.P
In other words, if we label patchset P(sub2) with the tag there are
earlier patchsets which need to be *partially* disregarded.
.SH "NOTE ON CVS VERSIONS"
Among the different cvs subcommands used by cvsps is the 'rlog'
command.  The rlog command is used to get revision history of a
module, and it disregards the current working directory.  The
important difference between 'rlog' and 'log' (from cvsps perspective)
is the 'rlog' will include log data for files not in the current
working directory.  The impact of this is mainly when there are
directories which at one time had files, but are now empty, and have
been pruned from the working directory with the '\-P' option.
If 'rlog' is not used, these files logs will not be parsed, and the
PatchSet numbering will be unstable.
.PP
The main problem with 'rlog' is that, until cvs version 1.11.1, 'rlog' was an
alias for the 'log' command.  This means, for old versions of cvs, 'rlog' has
different semantics and usage.  cvsps will attempt to work around this problem
by detecting capable versions of cvs.  If an old version is detected, 'log' will
be used instead of 'rlog', and YMMV.
.SH "NOTE ON GENERATED DIFFS"
Another important note is that cvsps will attempt, whenever possible,
to use the r\-commands (rlog, rdiff and co) instead of the local
commands (log, diff, and update).  This is to allow cvsps to function
without a completely checked out tree.  Because these r\-commands are
used, the generated diffs will include the module directory in them,
and it is recommended to apply them in the working directory with the
\-p1 option to the patch command.  However, if the \-\-diff\-opts
option is specified (to change, for example, the lines of context),
then rdiff cannot be used, because it doesn't support arbitrary
options.  In this case, the patches will be generated without the
module directory in the path, and \-p0 will be required when applying
the patch.  When diffs are generated in cvs\-direct mode (see below),
however, they will always be \-p1 style patches.
.SH "NOTE ON BKCVS"

The \-\-bkcvs option is a special operating mode that should only be
used when parsing the log files from the BK \-> CVS exported linux
kernel trees.  cvsps uses special semantics for recreating the BK
ChangeSet metadata that has been embedded in the log files for those
trees.  The \-\-bkcvs option should only be specified when the cache
file is being created or updated (i.e. initial run of cvsps, or when
\-u and \-x options are used).
.SH "NOTE ON CVS\-DIRECT"
As of version 2.0b6 cvsps has a partial implementation of the cvs
client code built in.  This reduces the RTT and/or handshaking
overhead from one per patchset member to one per patchset.  This
dramatically increases the speed of generating diffs over a slow link,
and improves the consistency of operation.  Currently the
\-\-cvs\-direct option turns on the use of this code, but it very well
may be default by the time 2.0 comes out.  The built\-in cvs code
attempts to be compatible with cvs, but may have problems, which
should be reported.  It honors the CVS_RSH and CVS_SERVER environment
variables, but does not parse the ~/.cvsrc file.
.SH "NOTE ON CVSPS RC FILE"
CVSps parses an rc file at startup.  This file should be located in
~/.cvsps/cvspsrc.  The file should contain arguments, in the exact
syntax as the command line, one per line.  If an argument takes a
parameter, the parameter should be on the same line as the argument.
.SH "NOTE ON DATE FORMATS"
Dates are reported in localtime, except that fast-export mode reports
UTC.  This can be overridden (as usual) using the TZ environment
variable.  The preferred input format for dates is as in RFC3339:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.  For backward compatibility with older
versions, 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss' is also accepted. As a contrived
example:
.IP "" 4
$ cvsps -d '2004-05-01T00:00:00' -d '2004/07/07 12:00:00'
