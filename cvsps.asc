    [-f 'file'] [-d 'date1' [-d 'date2']] [-l 'text'] [-b 'branch'] [-n]

    [-i] [-k] [-T] [-V] ['module-path']

== DESCRIPTION ==
cvsps tries to group the per-file commits and tags in a CVS project
repository into per-project changeset commits with common metadata, in
the style of Subversion and later version-control systems.

The older, default reporting mode is designed for humans to look at
and only includes commit metadata, not file contents.  The newer
--fast-export mode emits a git-style fast-import stream which can be
consumed by the importers for git and other version-control systems.

There are several different ways to invoke cvsps:

* From the top level of a CVS checkout directory, in which case no
root option or module-path argument is required.  (This case runs if
there is a CVS/Root beneath the current working directory.)

* From a module subdirectory within a CVS repository, in which case no
root option or module-path argument is required.  (This case runs if
there is a CVSROOT directory in the parent of the current working
directory.)

* From the top level of a CVS repository directory, in which case no
root option is required but a module-path argument is required. (This
case runs if the program sees a CVSROOT directory in the current
working directory.)

* With a root module specified via either the --root option or the
CVSROOT environment variable, in which case a module-path argument
is required.

In fast-export mode:

* Each patchset becomes a commit.

* CVS tags become git lightweight tags.

* The HEAD branch is renamed to 'master'.

* Other tag and branch names are sanitized to be legal for git;
  the characters ~^\*? are removed.

* Since .cvsignore files have a syntax upward-compatible with that
  of .gitignore files, they're renamed.

cvsps does not parse the $HOME/.cvsrc file.  If you have a
$HOME/.cvspass file (such as is normally created by cvs login) it will
be searched for a password.

== OPTIONS ==
-h::
display usage summary.
-z 'fuzz'::
set the timestamp fuzz factor for identifying patch sets.
-g::
generate diffs of the selected patch sets.
-s 'patchset'[-['patchset']][,'patchset'...]::
generate a diff for a given patchsets and patchset ranges.
-a 'author'::
restrict output to patchsets created by author.
-f 'regexp'::
restrict output to patchsets with filenames matching the specified regexp.
-d 'date1' -d 'date2'::
if just one date specified, show revisions newer than date1.  If two
dates specified, show revisions between two dates.
-l 'regex'::
restrict output to patchsets matching regex in log message. The
regular expressions use POSIX syntax.
-b 'branch'::
restrict output to patchsets affecting history of branch.
If you want to restrict to the main branch, use a branch of 'HEAD'.
-n:: 
negate filter sense, print all patchsetss *not* matching restrictions.
-r 'tag1' -r 'tag2'::
if just one tag specified, show revisions since tag1. If two tags
specified, show revisions between the two tags.
-p 'dir'::
output individual patchsets as files in 'dir' as 'dir'/'patchset'.patch.
-A 'authormap'::
Apply an author-map file to the attribution lines. Each line must be
of the form
+
------------------------------------------------------
ferd = Ferd J. Foonly <foonly@foo.com> America/Chicago
------------------------------------------------------
+
and will be applied to map the Unix username 'ferd' to the DVCS-style
user identity specified after the equals sign.  The timezone field
(after > and whitespace) is optional and (if present) is used to set
the timezone offset to be attached to the date; acceptable formats for
the timezone field are anything that can be in the TZ environment
variable, including a [+-]hhmm offset. Whitespace around the equals
sign is stripped.  Lines beginning with a # or not containing an
equals sign are silently ignored.
-R 'revmap'::
Write a revision map to the specified argument filename.  Each line of
the revision map consists of three whitespace-separated fields: a
filename, an RCS revision number, and the mark of the commit to which
that filename-revision pair was assigned.
-v::
show very verbose parsing messages.
-t::
show some brief memory usage statistics.
--summary-first::
when multiple patchset diffs are being generated, put the patchset
summary for all patchsets at the beginning of the output.
--diffs-opts 'option string'::
send a custom set of options to diff, for example to increase
the number of context lines, or change the diff format.
--debuglvl 'bitmask'::
enable various debug output channels.
-Z 'compression'::
A value 1-9 which specifies amount of compression.  A value of 0
disables compression.
--root 'cvsroot'::
Override the setting of CVSROOT (overrides working directory and
environment).
-i::
Incremental export.  Each commit with no ancestor gets a from pointer
with the value of refs/heads/${BRANCH}^0 where $BRANCH is its branch
name.  When importing to an existing repository, this will attach each 
such commit as a child of the last commit on $BRANCH in the existing
repository.
-k::
Kill keywords: will extract files with '-kk' from the CVS archive
to avoid noisy changesets.
-T::
Force deterministic dates for regression testing. Each patchset will
have a monotonic-increasing attributed date computed from its patchset ID.
--fast-export::
Emit the report as a git import stream.
--convert-ignores::
Convert ..cvsignore files to .gitignore files.
--reposurgeon::
Emit for each commit a list of the CVS file:revision pairs composing it as a
bzr-style commit property named "cvs-revisions".  From version 2.12
onward, reposurgeon can interpret these and use them as hints for
reference-lifting.
-V::
Emit the program version and exit.
'module-path'::
Operate on the specified module.  If this option is not given, either
the CVSROOT environment variable must be set to point directly at the
module or cvsps must be run in a checkout directory or repository
module subdirectory.

== COMPATIBILITY ==
The old --cvs-direct option, and the -u and -x options having to do
with local caching are gone; cvsps now always runs in direct mode and
without caching.  However, the -u command-line switch has been left in
place and tied to an informative termination message so that users of
older versions of calling scripts (such as git-cvsimport) will get
an error message rather than silent misbehavior.

The ancestor-branch tracking enabled by the -A option in some previous
versions of cvsps never worked properly and has been removed.  The new
-A option does author-name mapping, following the normal convention
for CVS and SVN translation tools.

== USAGE EXAMPLES ==
cvsps::
      Run within a checkout directory or a module subdirectory within
      a repository, dumps the history of its module in its repository
      in the old format.
cvsps --root :local:$PWD/foo --fast-export bar::
      Dump the history of module bar from a local repository directory foo in
      fast-export format.
cvsps --root esr@rfk.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/rfk robotfindskitten::
      Dump the CVS history of the robotfindskitten project on
      Sourceforge using esr's login credentials.
cvsps --root :pserver:esr@rfk.cvs.sourceforge.net/cvsroot/rfk robotfindskitten::
      Same request, (redundantly) specifying the pserver method.

== NOTE ON TAG HANDLING ==
Tags are fundamentally 'file at a time' in CVS, but like everything else,
it would be nice to imagine that they are 'repository at a time.'  The
approach cvsps takes is that a tag is assigned to a patchset.  The meaning
of this is that after this patchset, every revision of every file is after
the tag (and conversely, before this patchset, at least one file is still
before the tag).  

However, there are two kinds of inconsistent (or 'funky') tags that
can be created with older versions of CVS, even when following best
practices for CVS.  Newer version do an up-to-dateness check that
prevents these.

The first is what is called a *funky* tag.  A funky tag is one where
there are patchsets which are chronologically (and thus by patchset
id) earlier than the tag, but are tagwise after.  These tags will be
marked as '**FUNKY**' in the Tag: section of the cvsps output.  When a
funky tag is specified as one of the '-r' arguments, there are some
number of patchsets which need to be considered out of sequence.  In
this case, the patchsets themselves will be labeled FUNKY and will be
processed correctly.

The second is called an *invalid* tag.  An invalid tag is a tag where
there are patchsets which are chronologically (and thus by patchset
id) earlier than the tag, but which have members which are tagwise
both before, and after the tag, in the same patchset.  If an INVALID
tag is specified as one of the '-r' arguments, cvsps will flag each
member of the affected patchsets as before or after the tag and the
patchset summary will indicate which members are which, and diffs will
be generated accordingly.

These may be better explained by examples.  The easiest test case for 
this is two developers, starting in a consistent state.
(a)::
developer 1 changes file A(sub1) to A(sub2) and commits, creating
patchset P(sub1) chronologically earlier, thus with a lower patchset id.
(b)::
developer 2 changes file B(sub1) to B(sub2) and commits, creating
patchset P(sub2) chronologically later, thus higher patchset id.
(c)::
developer 2 B does fInotfR do "cvs update", so does not get A(sub2) in
working directory and creates a "tag" T(sub1)

A checkout of T(sub1) should have A(sub1) and B(sub2) and there is no
"patchset" that represents this. In other words, if we label patchset
P(sub2) with the tag there are earlier patchsets which need to be
disregarded.

An "invalid" tag can be generated with a similar testcase, except:

* In step (a) developer 1 also changes file C(sub1) to C(sub2)

* developer 2 does a "selective" cvs update of only file C(sub2)

* developer 1 does another change from C(sub2) to C(sub3), creating
a new patchset in between the previous P(sub1) and P(sub2)
"P(sub1(sub2))??"

* Then we have step (b) and step (c).  After this, a checkout of T(sub1)
should have A(sub1), B(sub2) and C(sub2).

In other words, if we label patchset P(sub2) with the tag there are
earlier patchsets which need to be *partially* disregarded.

== NOTE ON DATE FORMATS ==
Dates are reported in localtime, except that fast-export mode reports
UTC.  Three formats are accepted for the -d option:

* RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.
* A Unix-style timestamp (seconds since UTC epoch).
* For backward compatibility with older versions, 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss'.

As a contrived example:

   $ cvsps -d '2004-05-01T00:00:00' -d '2004/07/07 12:00:00'

== SEE ALSO ==
cvs(1)

== CVS LIMITATIONS ==
Translating CVS repositories to the generic DVCS model expressed by
import streams is not merely difficult and messy, there are weird
CVS cases that cannot be correctly translated at all.  cvsps will try to
warn you about these cases rather than silently producing broken or
incomplete translations.

CVS tags are per-file, not per revision. If developers are not careful
in their use of tagging, it can be impossible to associate a tag with
any of the changesets that cvsps resolves.

CVS-NT and versions of GNU CVS after 1.12 (2004) added a changeset
commit-id to file metadata. Older sections of CVS history without
these are vulnerable to various problems caused by clock skew between
clients; this used to be relatively common for multiple reasons,
including less pervasive use of NTP clock synchronization. cvsps will
warn you when it sees such a section in your history. When it does,
these caveats apply:

* If timestamps of commits in the CVS repository were not stable
enough to be used for ordering commits, changes may be reported in the
wrong order.

* If the timestamp order of different files crosses the revision order
within the commit-matching time window, the order of commits reported 
may be wrong.

These problems cannot be fixed in cvsps; they are inherent to CVS.

== CVSPS LIMITATIONS ==
cvsps may be unable to communicate with some extremely ancient CVS
server versions (this was a sacrifice for much faster performance).
It is unlikely any of these are still in service; if you trip over
one, mirror the repository locally with rsync or cvssuck and proceed.

CVS branches that were created but never got any file commits will
not be reported in the translated import stream.

If any files were ever imported more than once (e.g., import of
more than one vendor release), the head revision might contain
incorrect content.  cvsps issues a warning when this might occur.

If a CVS branch symbol could not be resolved to a translated 
commit, cvsps will issue a warning to that effect.
